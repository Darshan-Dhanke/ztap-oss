# ztap-oss

An **educational, open-source reconstruction** of the architecture Databricks
describes for Lakebase. **Not affiliated with or endorsed by Databricks.** This
project wires together existing open-source systems (PostgreSQL, Unity Catalog,
Debezium, Kafka, MinIO) and adds the connective components they don't ship.
Each bundled tool remains under its own license — see
[docs/LICENSES.md](docs/LICENSES.md) and consult the upstream repos before use.
**Not intended for commercial or as-a-service deployment.**

> The architecture (storage/compute split, branching, WAL→lakehouse CDC, a
> unified control plane) is an idea, and ideas aren't copyrightable. This repo
> reconstructs that idea from OSS parts in original code — it contains no
> Databricks source or documentation text.

## What's built (Phase 1)

This is the realistic first slice: the OSS data plane wired together, plus the
two custom "connective tissue" components that are fully testable.

- **Data plane** (`docker-compose.yml`): Postgres (logical replication) →
  Debezium → Kafka (KRaft); Unity Catalog for governance; MinIO as the
  lakehouse object store.
- **Custom #3 — control-plane API** (`services/control-plane`): the unified
  "project" abstraction. One `POST /projects` provisions a PG schema + Unity
  Catalog catalog + Debezium CDC connector, wired together; `DELETE` tears them
  down in reverse.
- **Custom #4 — type-engine** (`packages/type-engine`): Postgres↔Delta type
  mapping + conflict resolution, the piece most likely to cause silent
  corruption. Pure Python, honest about every lossy conversion.
- **Custom Delta sink** (`services/sink`): consumes the CDC stream from Kafka
  and writes **real Delta Lake tables into MinIO** (via delta-rs, no Spark) at
  the exact `storage_location` Unity Catalog registered — closing the loop so a
  Postgres row ends up queryable as Delta. Captures insert/update/delete.
- **Custom #2 — sync state machine** (`services/sync`): reconciles Postgres↔Unity
  Catalog schema drift (`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` → catalog updated), and applies
  lakehouse→Postgres changes through the #4 conflict engine with an idempotency
  ledger for loop-prevention.
- **Custom #1 — connection proxy** (`services/proxy`): a Go Postgres proxy that
  holds a client connection open during a (simulated) compute cold start, wakes
  the compute, and transparently splices the session through. Handles SSL/startup
  negotiation and buffers the startup packet; `/state` + `/suspend` HTTP API.

All four custom components (#1–#4) plus the Delta sink are built and tested. The
proxy simulates compute suspend/resume — there's no real scale-to-zero compute
here to stop (see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)).

## Quick start

```bash
cp .env.example .env

# unit tests for the custom components (no Docker needed)
make test-unit

# build + boot the full data plane
make up
make ps

# end-to-end smoke test: provision a project, prove CDC flows, tear down
make smoke
```

## Query the data

The **Postgres** side (the "compute") with any client (pgAdmin, psql) at
`localhost:55432` (db/user/pass `ztap`), or through the suspend/resume proxy at
`localhost:15432`.

The **lakehouse** side — the Delta tables the sink wrote to MinIO — with Trino:

```bash
# register a Delta table and query it (idempotent helper)
scripts/query_delta.sh lake orders
scripts/query_delta.sh lake orders "SELECT _op, count(*) FROM %T GROUP BY _op"

# inspect the Delta transaction log (commit history)
docker exec ztap-trino trino --catalog delta --schema lakehouse \
  --execute 'SELECT version, operation, timestamp FROM "lake_orders$history"'
```

Or point any Trino-compatible SQL client (DBeaver, etc.) at `localhost:18090`.

## Open the console

Then open:
- ztap console (dashboard) — http://localhost:18000/
- Control plane API docs — http://localhost:18000/docs
- Sync service API docs — http://localhost:18001/docs
- Unity Catalog — http://localhost:18080
- MinIO console — http://localhost:19001 (minioadmin / minioadmin)
- Kafka Connect — http://localhost:18083/connectors

## Create a project by hand

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:18000/projects -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"analytics"}'

curl localhost:18000/projects
```

You get back a Postgres schema `proj_analytics`, a Unity Catalog catalog
`ztap_analytics` (with a `cdc` schema), and a running Debezium connector
streaming that schema's WAL to Kafka topics under `ztap.analytics.*`.

### Register a table into Unity Catalog (UC + type-engine wired together)

```bash
# create a table in the project schema, then register it
docker exec ztap-postgres psql -U ztap -d ztap -c \
  "CREATE TABLE proj_analytics.events (id bigint primary key, doc jsonb, dur interval, tags int[]);"

curl -X POST localhost:18000/projects/analytics/tables \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"table":"events"}'
```

The control plane introspects the live Postgres table, maps every column
through the **type-engine**, creates the table in Unity Catalog
(`ztap_analytics.cdc.events`), and returns a `lossy_columns` list naming each
column whose conversion loses information (here `doc`/`dur`/`tags`) with the
reason. That's the silent-corruption surface made visible at registration time.

## Layout

```
docker-compose.yml          OSS data plane (offset ports, own network)
services/control-plane/     custom #3 — FastAPI control plane + tests
services/sink/              custom Delta sink — Kafka CDC -> Delta on MinIO + tests
services/sync/             custom #2 — schema reconcile + reverse sync + tests
services/proxy/            custom #1 — suspend/resume Postgres proxy (Go) + tests
packages/type-engine/       custom #4 — type mapping + conflict engine + tests
scripts/smoke_test.sh       end-to-end CDC smoke test
scripts/edge_tests.sh       edge-case integration tests (nasty types, UC, teardown)
scripts/sink_test.sh        Delta sink integration test (insert/update/delete -> Delta)
scripts/sync_test.sh        #2 integration test (schema evolution + reverse sync)
scripts/proxy_test.sh       #1 integration test (cold-start wake through the proxy)
